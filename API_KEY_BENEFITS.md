## 💰 Cost Breakdown

### Free Tier (Perfect for You!)
```
Quota: 10,000 queries/day
Cost: $0.00
Perfect for: Development, Small Projects, Learning

Example:
- 50 users
- 20 scans per user per day
= 1,000 queries/day
= Still 9,000 queries remaining!
```

### Paid Tier (If You Ever Need It)
```
Cost: $0.50 per 1,000 queries
Example:
- 20,000 queries/day = 10,000 free + 10,000 paid
- Cost = $0.50 × 10 = $5/day = ~$150/month
- This is for VERY high traffic (unlikely needed)
```
