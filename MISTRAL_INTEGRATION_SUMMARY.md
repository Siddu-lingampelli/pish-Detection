## How It Works

### 1. Detection Flow
```
User scans URL
    â†“
Backend runs phishing detection
    â†“
Result passed to mistralExplanationService
    â†“
If API key configured:
    â†’ Calls Mistral AI for natural language explanation
    â†’ Returns AI-generated text + safety tips
If no API key:
    â†’ Generates basic explanation
    â†’ Returns generic tips
    â†“
Response sent to frontend with ai_explanation object
    â†“
Frontend displays explanation in colored card
```

### 2. API Response Structure
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "url": "https://example.com",
    "result": "Legit",
    "confidence_score": 0.95,
    "ai_explanation": {
      "text": "This URL appears legitimate based on...",
      "generated_by": "Generated by Mistral AI",
      "safety_tips": [
        "Always verify the website's SSL certificate...",
        "Bookmark frequently visited legitimate sites...",
        "..."
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### 3. UI Display
- Color-coded card (green/yellow/red based on result)
- Main explanation text
- Bulleted safety tips
- Attribution footer

## Features

### âœ… With Mistral API Key
- AI-generated natural language explanations
- Context-aware analysis of detection results
- Detailed reasoning for classification
- Personalized safety recommendations
- Mentions specific risk factors found

### âœ… Without Mistral API Key (Fallback)
- Basic explanations still provided
- Generic but useful analysis
- Standard safety tips
- System fully functional

## Configuration Required

### Step 1: Get Mistral API Key
1. Visit: https://console.mistral.ai/
2. Sign up or login
3. Create new API key
4. Copy the key

### Step 2: Add to Environment
Edit `server/.env`:
```env
MISTRAL_API_KEY=your_actual_key_here
```

### Step 3: Restart Server
```bash
cd server
npm start
```

## Testing

### Test Without API Key
1. Don't add API key or use placeholder
2. Scan any URL
3. Should see: "Generated by basic explanation service"

### Test With API Key
1. Add valid Mistral API key to .env
2. Restart backend server
3. Scan any URL
4. Should see: "Generated by Mistral AI"
5. Explanations should be more detailed and contextual

## Example Outputs

### Legitimate URL
```
âœ… AI Analysis
This URL appears legitimate based on standard HTTP protocol, absence of 
suspicious keywords, and clean reputation from Google Safe Browsing. The 
domain structure follows normal patterns without obvious phishing indicators.

Safety Tips:
â€¢ Always verify the website's SSL certificate before entering sensitive data
â€¢ Bookmark frequently visited legitimate sites to avoid typosquatting
â€¢ Be cautious even with legitimate-looking URLs

### Phishing URL
```
ðŸš¨ AI Analysis
This URL shows multiple red flags including suspicious keywords ('login', 
'verify'), no HTTPS encryption, and detection by Google Safe Browsing as a 
phishing site. The domain pattern mimics legitimate services to deceive users.

Safety Tips:
â€¢ DO NOT enter any personal information on this site
â€¢ Report this URL to your IT security team or relevant authorities
â€¢ Close the browser tab immediately
â€¢ Run a full antivirus scan if you interacted with this site
â€¢ Change passwords if you entered credentials
â€¢ Monitor your accounts for suspicious activity

## Benefits

1. **Educational**: Users learn why URLs are dangerous/safe
2. **Actionable**: Safety tips provide clear next steps
3. **Trust**: Transparent AI explanations build confidence
4. **Fallback**: System works with or without API
5. **Contextual**: Explanations reference actual risk factors found

## Technical Details

### Mistral Model Used
- **Model**: `mistral-tiny`
- **Reasoning**: Fast, cost-effective, suitable for short explanations
- **Temperature**: 0.3 (balanced consistency/creativity)
- **Max Tokens**: 250 (concise responses)

### Error Handling
- API errors don't break the scan
- Automatic fallback to basic explanations
- Logged for debugging
- User still gets useful information

### Cost Considerations
- Each URL scan = 1 API call
- Free tier available on Mistral
- Paid plans for high volume
- Can disable anytime by removing key

## Customization

### Change AI Model
Edit `mistralExplanationService.js`:
```javascript
model: 'mistral-small',  // or 'mistral-medium'
```

### Adjust Response Length
```javascript
max_tokens: 500,  // Longer explanations
```

### Customize Prompts
Modify `buildPrompt()` method to change how AI analyzes URLs

### Modify Safety Tips
Edit `generateSafetyTips()` to add/remove/change tips

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Still seeing basic explanations with valid key
**Solution**: Restart backend server after adding key

### Issue: API errors in console
**Solution**: Check Mistral console for quota/rate limits

### Issue: Key not working
**Solution**: Verify key is correct, no extra spaces, active in Mistral console
