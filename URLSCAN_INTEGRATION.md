## 🔐 Privacy & Security

### Your Implementation:
- **Visibility**: Set to `unlisted` by default
- **Tags**: Automatically tagged with `phishing-detection`, `automated-scan`
- **Rate Limits**: URLScan.io allows limited free scans
- **Data Storage**: Scans stored on URLScan.io servers (public service)

### Privacy Considerations:
⚠️ **Important**: URLs submitted to URLScan.io are scanned on their infrastructure
- Use `visibility: 'private'` for sensitive URLs (requires paid plan)
- Public scans are searchable on urlscan.io
- Screenshots and data persist on URLScan.io servers

---

## 🎯 Integration Benefits

### Before URLScan.io:
- 5 detection layers
- No visual verification
- Limited SSL validation
- No technology stack info

### After URLScan.io:
- **7 detection layers** (including URLScan + your local analysis)
- **Visual proof** via screenshots
- **Deep SSL/TLS analysis**
- **Technology fingerprinting**
- **Network behavior tracking**
- **Community-driven intelligence**

---

## 📈 Performance Impact

### Response Times:
- **Initial Scan**: +200-500ms (non-blocking submission)
- **Full Report**: Available after 10-30 seconds (retrieved separately)

### Rate Limits:
- **Free Tier**: Limited scans per day
- **Solution**: Quick submission (non-blocking) preserves UX
- **Best Practice**: Retrieve full results only when needed

---

## 🛠️ Advanced Usage

### Method 1: Quick Scan (Current Implementation)
```javascript
// Submit and return immediately
const submission = await urlscanService.quickScan(url);
// Scan ID included in response
// User can view report later
```

### Method 2: Wait for Results (Optional)
```javascript
// Submit and wait up to 50 seconds
const results = await urlscanService.scanAndWait(url, 10, 5000);
// Returns complete analysis
// May timeout if scan takes too long
```

### Method 3: Manual Retrieval
```javascript
// Get results by scan ID
const results = await urlscanService.getResults(scanId);
```
